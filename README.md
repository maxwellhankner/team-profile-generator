# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This project is all about teamwork. You can use this application to generate an html page for your next team project. Just follow the prompts and enter your teams information. Once you are done with that, an html page will be available for you to copy and publish. The page leverages bootstrap for its layout and style but you can always add your own touch if you know what you are doing, of course. The application will let you build your team with one manager and as many engineers and interns as you desire. 

## Usage
To use this application, just copy the code into your own project directory or clone it to you local machine. If you have node and npm, just install the dev dependencies by running 'npm i' and then run the app.js by running 'node app.js' in the terminal. Then, just follow the prompts and get your html file from the output directory.

## Not Included
If I had more time to work on this project, I would add a few things. First off, I would not allow a user to enter in bad information like a number for the name input or the ability to use the same id for multiple team member. I would also work on the output html file a bit more and make it look less stock bootstrappy. One other thing I would add is the ability to add custom types of team members like a contractor, or maybe a designer.
